        "In this tutorial, we will will perform QLORA SFT on `Llama-2 7B` for the curated [mini-platypus-1k dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/garg-aayush/mini-platypus-1K) using huggingface's [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) library\n",
        "\n",
        "> Modified from Maxime Labonne's [Fine-tune Llama 2 on Google Colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p68M5E5fZ7kSa7nA-e-20489nuFSXVp2?usp=sharing)\n",
        "\n",
        "Base models like Llama 2 can **predict the next token** in a sequence. However, this does not make them particularly useful assistants since they don't reply to instructions. This is why we employ instruction tuning to align their answers with what humans expect. There are two main fine-tuning techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **Supervised Fine-Tuning** (SFT): Models are trained on a dataset of instructions and responses. It adjusts the weights in the LLM to minimize the difference between the generated answers and ground-truth responses, acting as labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback** (RLHF): Models learn by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback. They are trained to maximize a reward signal (using [PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)), which is often derived from human evaluations of model outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, RLHF is shown to capture **more complex and nuanced** human preferences, but is also more challenging to implement effectively. Indeed, it requires careful design of the reward system and can be sensitive to the quality and consistency of human feedback. An alternative to RLHF is the [Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) (DPO) algorithm, which directly runs preference learning on the SFT model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why does fine-tuning work in the first place?** \n",
        "- As highlighted in the [Orca paper](https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/notes/Large%20Language%20Models/orca.html), fine-tuning **leverages knowledge learned during the pretraining** process. In other words, fine-tuning will be of little help if the model has never seen the kind of data you're interested in. However, if that's the case, SFT can be extremely performant.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- For example, the [LIMA paper](https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/notes/Large%20Language%20Models/lima.html) showed one can outperform GPT-3 (DaVinci003) by fine-tuning a LLaMA (v1) model with 65 billion parameters on only 1,000 high-quality samples. The **quality of the instruction dataset is essential** to reach this level of performance, which is why a lot of work is focused on this issue (like [evol-instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244), Orca, or [phi-1](https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/notes/Large%20Language%20Models/phi1.html)). \n",
        "\n",
        "- Note that the size of the LLM (65b, not 13b or 7b) is also fundamental to leverage pre-existing knowledge efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "One can check the best performing open-source LLMs on [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard). It tracks, evaluates, and ranks open Large Language Models (LLMs) and chatbots. a"

        "There are three options for supervised fine-tuning: \n",
        "\n",
        "### Full fine-tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically, one performs \"full fine-tuning\": this means that one simply updates all the weights of the base model during fine-tuning. This is then typically done either in full precision (`float32`), or mixed precision (a combination of `float32` and `float16`). However, with ever larger models like LLMs, this becomes infeasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For reference, float32 means that each parameter of a model gets saved in 32 bits or 4 bytes. \n",
        "- Hence, for a 7 billion parameter model like Mistral-7B, one requires 7 billion parameters * 4 bytes per parameter = **28 GB of GPU RAM**, just to load the model. \n",
        "- During training with an optimizer like AdamW, one not only requires memory for the model but also for the gradients and optimizer states, which roughly comes down to approximately 18 times the size of the model in gigabytes when training with mixed precision.\n",
        "- In our case 7 * 18 = `126 GB of GPU RAM`. And that's just for a 7B parameter model\n",
        "\n",
        "**How 18 times?**\n",
        "- Model Weights: 6 bytes * number of parameters for mixed precision training (maintains a model in fp32 and one in fp16 in memory)\n",
        "- Optimizer States: 8 bytes * number of parameters for normal AdamW (maintains 2 states)\n",
        "- Gradients: 4 bytes * number of parameters for either fp32 or mixed precision training (gradients are always kept in fp32)\n",

        "### LoRA fine-tuning\n",
        "Low-rank adaption([LORA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)) is a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (peft) method. In LoRA, rather than performing full fine-tuning, one freeze's the existing model and only add a few parameter weights to the model (called `\"adapters\"`), which are trained. LoRa is available in the [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) library by Hugging Face, which also supports various other PEFT methods but LoRa is the most popular one atleast for now.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### QLoRA fine-tuning\n",
        "Quantized LoRA ([QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314)) is even more efficient method. With regular LoRa, one would keep the base model in 32 or 16 bits in memory, and then train the parameter weights. However, there have been new methods developed to shrink the size of a model considerably, to 8 or 4 bits per parameter (this is called \"quantization\"). Hence, if one apply's LoRa to a quantized model (like a 4-bit model), then it is called QLoRa.\n",
